Hi! I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Brown University. My research interests center around three core pillars of general intelligence:

- **Reasoning and Planning**: enabling models to make structured decisions and solve complex tasks.  
- **Representation Learning (World Modeling)**: learning abstract, accurate representations of the environment.  
- **Memory and Adaptation**: spanning both long-context memory and continual learning.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Sydney with a major in Computer Science and Mathematics, receiving the University Medal as the **top-ranked (1st)** undergraduate. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Dacheng Tao during my Honours year. 

I was also awarded the Sydney Chancellorâ€™s Award, a prestigious full-tuition scholarship recognizing my [**1st-in-state**](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/chinese/zh-hans/podcast-episode/how-did-the-new-migrant-wenquan-lu-receive-top-atar-in-hsc/o0orxe9cc) performance in the [HSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_School_Certificate_(New_South_Wales)), valued at $10,000 per annum throughout my undergraduate degree.

I am actively seeking research collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
