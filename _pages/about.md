Hi! I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Brown University. My research interests center around three core pillars of general intelligence:

- **Reasoning and Planning**: enabling models to make structured decisions and solve complex tasks.  
- **Representation Learning (World Modeling)**: learning abstract, accurate representations of the environment.  
- **Memory and Adaptation**: spanning both long-context memory and continual learning.

Previously, I graduated from the University of Sydney with a major in Computer Science and Mathematics, receiving the University Medal as the **top-ranked (1st)** undergraduate. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Dacheng Tao during my Honours year. 

I am actively seeking research collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
